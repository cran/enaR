\title{
%%  ~~function to do ... ~~
Checks the balance of inputs and outputs from a network.
}
\description{
%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
This function supports the balancing process by checking if the inputs
and outputs of a given network model are within acceptable limits.
}
\usage{
ssCheck(x = "network object", tol = 5,more=FALSE)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
A network object.
}
  \item{tol}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{tol} here~~
The threshold for balance in percent difference between input and
outputs.
}
  \item{more}{
%%     ~~Describe \code{x} here~~
LOGICAL: are any node differences greater than tolerance
}
}

\value{
Returns a logical value stating if the model is within acceptable limits
of balance (TRUE) or if it is not (FALSE).
%%  ~Describe the value returned
%%  If it is a LIST, use
%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
