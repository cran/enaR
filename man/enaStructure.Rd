\usage{
enaStructure(x = "network object")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A network object.}
}
\value{
\item{A}{

} \item{ns}{A vector of structure based network statistics. These include n
= number of nodes, L = number of edges, C = connectivity, LD = link density,
ppr = pathway proliferation rate, lam1A = dominant eigenvalue, mlam1A =
multiplicity of dominant eigenvalue, rho = damping ratio, R = distance of
the dominant eigen value from the eigen spectra, d = difference between
dominant eigen value and link density, no.scc = number of strongly connected
components, no.scc.big = number of strongly connected components with more
than one node, pscc = percent of nodes in strongly connected components.  }
