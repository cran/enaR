\title{
Repeated, sequential application the balance function.
}
\description{
This function repeatedly balances a model, sequentially with the output
being passed back to the balance function, until it is  within tolerance
or the maximum number of iterations is reached. 
}
\usage{
force.balance(x='network object',tol=5,max.itr=10,method='AVG2')
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    A network object.
  }
  \item{tol}{
    Percent error tolerance for difference between inputs and outputs.
  }
  \item{max.itr}{
    Maximum number iterations.
  }
  \item{method}{
    The balancing method to use, see balance.
  }
}

\value{
%%  ~Describe the value returned

%%  \item{comp1 }{Description of 'comp1'}
%%  \item{comp2 }{Description of 'comp2'}
%% ...
Returns a balanced network model.
