%%  ~~ A concise (1-5 lines) description of what the function does. ~~
"Unpacks" the components of a network object into separate objects.
This includes inputs, exports, respirations, outputs (exports +
respirations), storage, and internal flows.

\usage{
unpack(x = "network object")

%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{x}{A  network object.  This includes all weighted flows into and out of
    each node. }
}

\value{
  \item{F}{matrix of flows from each node to each node oreinted row to column.}
  \item{z}{Node boundary inputs.}
  \item{r}{Node boundary loss from respiration.}
  \item{e}{Node boundary loss due to exportation}
  \item{y}{Node boundary loss; summation of r and e}
  \item{X}{Node storage or biomass}
