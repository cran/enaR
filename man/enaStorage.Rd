  Storage Analyses of Ecological Networks
}
\description{
  Calculates storage-based Ecological Network Analyses.
}
\usage{
enaStorage(x, balance.override = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{x}{
    A network object.  This This includes all weighted flows into and out of
    each vertex as well as the amount of energy--matter stored at each vertex.   
  }
  \item{balance.override}{
    LOGICAL: should an imbalanced model be analyzed?  
    If FALSE, the functions checks to make sure the
    network model provided is at steady-state.  If TRUE, then the
    function will run without ensuring that the model meets the
    steady-state assumption.
}
}

\value{
  \item{X}{The storage values themselves.}
  \item{C}{output or donor-storage normalized output-oriented direct flow
  intensity matrix (Jacobian community matrix)}
  \item{S}{dimensionalized integral output community matrix}
  \item{Q}{integral output storage matrix - non-dimensional}
  \item{CP}{input or recipient-storage normalized oriented flow intensity matrix (Jacobian community matrix)}
  \item{SP}{dimensionalized integral input community matrix}
  \item{QP}{integral input storage matrix - non-dimensional}
  \item{dt}{selected time step to create P, PP, Q and QP - smallest whole number to make diag(C) nonnegative}
  \item{ns}{vector of the storage based whole system network statistics.
    These statistics include total system storage (TSS), storage cycling
    index (CIS), Boundary storage intensity (BSI), Direct storage
    intensity (DSI), Indirect storage intensity (ISI), realized ratio of
    indirect-to-direct storage (ID.S), unit input-oriented ratio of
    indirect-to-direct storage intensities (IDS.I), unit output ratio of
    indirect-to-direct storage intensities (IDS.O), input-oriented
    storage-based network homogenization (HMG.S.I), output-oriented
    storage-based network homogenization (HMG.S.O), input-oriented
    storage-based network amplification (AMP.S.I), output-oriented
    storage-based network amplification (AMP.S.O), Storage from Boundary
    flow (mode0.S), storage from internal first passage flow (mode1.S),
    storage from cycled flow (mode2.S), dissipative equivalent to
    mode1.S (mode3.S), dissipative equivalent to mode0.S (mode4.S).}
